# VISION: The Co-Founder (Knowledge Engine)

## 1. The Core Concept
A "Voice-First" AI Partner that acts as a container for free-flowing consciousness.
*   **The Input:** Messy, stream-of-consciousness brain dumps (Voice/Text).
*   **The Output:** Structured, evolved ideas sorted into specific "Buckets" (Projects).
*   **The Vibe:** A brainstorming partner ("That's a good idea, what if we did this?"). Not just a passive scribe.

## 2. The Hierarchy of Ideas
Every idea exists on two planes:
1.  **The Vision Layer:** The "Big Idea." Everything is possible. Dream state.
2.  **The Practical Layer:** The "MVP." Execution details. How do we actually build it?

## 3. The Architecture of Truth
*   **The Top Level (The Co-Founder):** Knows everything. Sees connections between projects ("Hey, that idea from Vibe Coder fits here"). Prevents silos but manages leakage.
*   **The Project Level (The Producer):** Contained execution. Deep context on *one* thing. No leakage between projects at this level.

## 4. The Roadmap (Evolution)
*   **Phase 1 (Now):** Text-based Interface. Capture & Structure.
*   **Phase 2:** Voice Interface (Audio-First). "Talk to it like a phone."
*   **Phase 3:** Multi-Project Routing. The AI automatically sorts an idea into "Vibe Coder" vs. "Dog Walker App" vs. "Miscellaneous."
