VISION: The Co-Founder (Knowledge Engine)
=========================================

1\. The Core Concept
--------------------

A "Voice-First" AI Partner that acts as a container for free-flowing consciousness.

*   **The Input:** Messy, stream-of-consciousness brain dumps (Voice/Text).
    
*   **The Output:** Structured, evolved ideas sorted into specific "Buckets" (Projects).
    
*   **The Vibe:** A brainstorming partner ("That's a good idea, what if we did this?"). Not just a passive scribe.
    
*   **The Architecture:** **The Sidecar Pattern.**
    
    *   **Fast Lane (Conversation):** Zero-latency, tool-less chat. Keeps the user in "Flow State."
        
    *   **Slow Lane (Structure):** Asynchronous processing that updates the "Truth" without blocking the user.
        

2\. The Hierarchy of Ideas
--------------------------

Every idea exists on two planes:

1.  **The Vision Layer:** The "Big Idea." Everything is possible. Dream state.
    
2.  **The Practical Layer:** The "MVP." Execution details. How do we actually build it?
    

3\. The Architecture of Truth (Memory Model)
--------------------------------------------

We do not rely on reading 1,000 past chat logs (Token Bloat). We rely on **Just-in-Time Context Injection**.

*   **The Index (The Map):** A high-level registry of all active projects. The AI knows _what_ exists.
    
*   **The User Profile (The Mirror):** A living document of the Founder's preferences, style, and philosophy. The AI knows _who_ you are.
    
*   **The Vault (The Details):** Deep documentation (VISION.md, ROADMAP.md) that is only loaded when a specific project is active.
    

4\. The Roadmap (Evolution)
---------------------------

*   **Phase 1 (Completed):** Text-based Interface. Manual Snapshotting. Memory Injection.
    
*   **Phase 2:** **Voice Interface (Audio-First).** "Talk to it like a phone."
    
*   **Phase 3:** **The Invisible Scribe.** Remove the "Snapshot" button. The AI should intelligently decide _when_ to update the Board/Memory based on conversation pauses or topic shifts.
    
*   **Phase 4:** **Multi-Project Routing.** The AI automatically sorts an idea into "Vibe Coder" vs. "Dog Walker App" vs. "Miscellaneous" without being told.
